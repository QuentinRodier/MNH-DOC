\section{Purpose}
%\section{Equations}
For some academic studies (1D PBL dynamics, 2D Eady wave problem, 2D mountain
flow, moving squall lines, 3D breeze studies...), it is necessary to impose a
large scale environment even crudely (geostrophic wind, subsidence, ... ), in
order to perform consistent simulations with Meso-NH. Practically, this means
that some additional forcing terms have to be included in the Meso-NH system of
equation.

Actually, only the most usual physical forcing terms have been taken into
account for simplicity. The forcing terms are prescribed empirically from
external sources of information ({\it e.g.} series of observation) and are
mutually independent when acting on the same prognostic variable. Generally
they are non-stationary and horizontally homogeneous, only the case of
flat terrain is addressed. Furthermore, forcing terms are considered for
the restricted cartesian geometry of Meso-NH (constant Coriolis parameter).

The effects of several forcings are considered:

\begin{tabular}{l c}
                                               &\\

                                               &\\
\end{tabular}

                                               & \\
$\bullet$ Large scale variables $\alpha \in [u, v, \theta, r_{v} ]$:
   & $\dfrac{\partial \alpha}{\partial t}\Big|_{FRC}=- \dfrac{\alpha - \alpha_{frc}}{\tau_{frc}}$ \\

                                               &\\
\end{tabular}

In the above definitions, the subscript $_{frc}$ tags the forcing fields or scalars
which must be provided by the user for a specific application. The forcing terms
are written in the form of a tendency of the relevant prognostic variable.

\section{Modified equations}
The inclusion of the forcing terms (single underbraced for the physical
terms and double underbraced for the Newtonian relaxation terms) in the
Meso-NH system of equation is made as follows:

\bigskip
\noindent {\bf Conservation of momentum}
\begin{eqnarray}
{\partial \over \partial t} (\rho_{dref} \vec U) & +
\vec \nabla \cdot (\rho_{dref} \vec U\otimes \vec U) + \rho_{dref} \vec \nabla \Phi + \rho_{dref} \vec g \dfrac{\theta_v - \theta_{vref}}{\theta_{vref}}+
2\rho_{dref} \vec \Omega \wedge (\vec U - \underbrace{\vec U_{frc}})
\nonumber \\
 &+ \underbrace{w_{frc} \dfrac{\partial u}{\partial z} \vec i}
  + \underbrace{w_{frc} \dfrac{\partial v}{\partial z} \vec j}
  = \rho_{dref} \vec {\cal F}
- \underbrace{\underbrace{\dfrac{u - u_{frc}}{\tau_{frc}} \vec i}}
- \underbrace{\underbrace{\dfrac{v - v_{frc}}{\tau_{frc}} \vec j}}
\end{eqnarray}

\noindent {\bf Thermodynamic equation}
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eqfrc1}
&\dfrac{\partial }{\partial t} (\rho_{dref} \theta)
+ \vec \nabla \cdot  (\rho_{dref} \theta \vec U)+ \rho_{dref} \Big(
  \underbrace{u (\dfrac{\partial \theta }{ \partial x})_{frc}}
+ \underbrace{v (\dfrac{\partial \theta }{ \partial y})_{frc}}
+ \underbrace{w_{frc} \dfrac{\partial \theta }{\partial z}}
\Big) =  \rho_{dref} \Big[ \dfrac{R_d + r_v R_v C_{pd}} {R_d    C_{ph}}
\nonumber \\
& -1 \Big]
 \dfrac{
\theta} {\Pi_{ref}} w \dfrac{\partial \Pi_{ref}} {\partial z}
 + \dfrac{\rho_{dref}} {\Pi_{ref} C_{ph}} \Big[ L_m
\dfrac{D(r_i + r_s + r_g + r_h)} {Dt} - L_v \dfrac{Dr_v} {Dt} + \cal H \Big]
- \underbrace{\underbrace{\dfrac{\theta - \theta_{frc}} {\tau_{frc}}}}
\end{eqnarray}

\noindent {\bf Conservation of the water vapor mixing ratio}
\begin{equation}
{\partial \over \partial t}(\rho_{dref} r_{v}) + \vec \nabla \cdot
(\rho_{dref} r_{v} \vec U)+ \rho_{dref} \Big(
  \underbrace{u (\dfrac{\partial r_{v} }{ \partial x})_{frc}}
+ \underbrace{v (\dfrac{\partial r_{v} }{ \partial y})_{frc}}
+ \underbrace{w_{frc} \dfrac{\partial r_{v} }{\partial z}}
\Big) = \rho_{dref} Q_{v}
- \underbrace{\underbrace{\dfrac{r_{v}-r_{v\ frc}}{\tau_{frc}}}}
\end{equation}

\noindent {\bf Conservation of the condensed water mixing ratios}
\begin{equation}
{\partial \over \partial t}(\rho_{dref} r_\star) + \vec \nabla \cdot
(\rho_{dref} r_\star \vec U)+ \rho_{dref}
\underbrace{w_{frc} \dfrac{\partial r_\star }{\partial z}} = \rho_{dref} Q_\star
\end{equation}

\bigskip
These forced terms are not independent from each other, the horizontal
gradient of $\theta$ (baroclinicity) is related to the geostrophic wind by
the "thermal wind" equation which takes the following form:

\begin{equation}
\dfrac{\partial u_{frc}}{\partial z} = + {g \over f \theta_{vref}} (\dfrac{\partial \theta_v}
{\partial y} )_{frc}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\dfrac{\partial v_{frc}}{\partial z} = - {g \over f \theta_{vref}} (\dfrac{\partial \theta_v}
{\partial x} )_{frc}
\end{equation}
where $u_{frc}$ and $v_{frc}$ are the horizontal components of the geostrophic
wind and $f = 2 \vec \Omega \cdot \vec k$, the (constant) Coriolis parameter.

The forced temperature gradients are deduced from these relations but beware
that condensation modify gradients of $\theta$ or $r_{v}$ and so forced
gradients of $\theta$ or forced advection of humidity might be excessive in
some circumstances.

The relaxation towards large scale variables is useful to constraint a free
atmosphere state to match series of observation above a specified height level.

\section{Interpolation}
The series of asynchronous 1D forcing data are provided by the Meso-NH user
in a special format (see the {\bf Forced version} described in the
{\bf Meso-NH user's guide}).
Then they are linearly interpolated to fill the Meso-NH vertical grid system
and stored in the LFI files.
In the case of orography, these fields are further projected on the horizontal
embedded grids of Meso-NH by linear interpolation.

The time-evolution of the forcings is obtained by linear interpolation between
two bounding forcing fields at each time step. When the last forcing data is
reached a stationary forcing is kept on. Conversely, no forcing is applied
until the current time of the Meso-NH integration has reached that of the first
forcing data. The following scheme summarizes how a set of 3 forcing data are
used during the model integration starting at time DTEXP.

\section{Discretization}
The vertical transport $w_{frc}(\dfrac{\partial \alpha}{\partial z})$ is lagged
and integrated with a first order upstream scheme to ensure positivity in some
situation, {\it e.g.} the case of large scale subsidence over a shallow
inversion in the stratus cloud modeling problem. The numerical scheme of the
large scale horizontal transport is time centered and the horizontal forcing
gradients
$(\dfrac{\partial \alpha}{\partial x})_{frc}$ and
$(\dfrac{\partial \alpha}{\partial y})_{frc}$ are assumed to be given on the
$\alpha$ (mass) grid.
The integration of the large scale relaxation terms is lagged for numerical
stability. This term applies either above a constant selected height or above
a time evolving thermal inversion (useful for PBL dynamics studies).
