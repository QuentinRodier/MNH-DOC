%\section{Model description}
%-------------------------------------
%The cloud scheme can be divided into two main components: the 
%{\bf sub-grid} cloud
%model and the {\bf resolved} cloud model. 
%For large horizontal grid resolutions, the grid size will be larger than the 
%size of a typical convective cloud, requiring a parameterization for these
%sub-grid clouds. The sub-grid cloud scheme simulates convective 
%precipitating and non-precipitation clouds (see Chapter:Convection Scheme).
%The second component of the cloud model considers clouds which occupy the 
%entire grid cell and have been "resolved" by the model. The rate of change in 
%pollutant concentrations ($s_i$) due to cloud processes is given by:
%$$
%\frac{\partial C_i}{\partial t} = \frac{\partial C_i}{\partial t}_{subcld} + \frac{\partial C_i}{\partial t}_{rescld}
%$$
